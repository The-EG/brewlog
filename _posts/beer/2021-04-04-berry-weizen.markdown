An attempt at something like a berliner weisse, but I wanted to try something different. I've heard that goodbelly probiotic shots are a good source of lactobacillus. Normally a kettle sour would be done, but I wanted to try souring during fermentation instead, since the IBUs were so low. Worst case, I end up with a fruity weizen instead!
