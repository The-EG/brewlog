  notes: >-
    - Collected ~5.5 gallons of wort. Hit expected gravities, but had
      slightly more wort than expected, so a bit better efficiency.
    - Made a 2 liter starter, decanted before pitching.
    
    - Pitched starter @ 17:45 2020-06-28. Wort @ 71F.

My lager recipe, but this time actually fermented with a lager yeast!

This turned out really nice. Surprisingly clear for not being filtered or using any clarifiers other than irish moss. Light, clean but with a bit of a caramel note.
