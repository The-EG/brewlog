I was trying to figure out what to brew next and complaining to Suzanne that I wasn't inspired by anything. Nothing sounded good. It was like being hungry but not wanting food.

So, I decided I should do something appropriate for the season, and apples came to mind. Yeah! I've never done anything with apples, so that should be interesting.

After some Googling, I decided I would need a lot of apples...like 9 lbs worth. Half would be cubed (that's the pic above) and steeped at the end of the boil, and half would be shredded and go in during secondary.

I started with a basic brown/amber ale and added some Molasses; I'm going for a 'candied apple' effect, but hopefully not too sweet or overpowering...

*2020-11-17*: Not bad! When I kegged this I was worried the cinnamon was going to overpower everything, but it has mellowed out a bit while carbing. I don't know that it makes me think of apple, but it's definitely a winter-y spiced ale.

*2020-12-30*: After aging a bit more this is quite nice. It definitely needed a month or so to mellow out.
