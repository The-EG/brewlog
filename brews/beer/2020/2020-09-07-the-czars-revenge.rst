This is a couple of firsts:
 - The first time I've ever brewed a beer while I still have the same beer on tap. (In my defense, it's really good and I let it age a good 6 months prior to drinking it...)
 - The first time I've tried using oak
 
 I bought these in 'the before time,' before COVID-19 with no real plan on what to use them on...but with the thought that having it would force me to try it.

I figured an imperial stout was as good a thing as any. The package says both sticks for 6 gallons...and I have a bit over 5...so both sticks went in!

I'll see in a couple weeks how the flavor is.
