My first brew in a very long time, I figured it would be good to do something simple.

It went mostly well except a miscalculation for sparge water volume. I ended up with a little over half a gallon too much wort!

Since the 4 gallon kettle was already full I had to boil it for 75 minutes first, until there was finally enough room to pour in the rest and do the actual 60 minute boil.
